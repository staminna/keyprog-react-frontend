# Implementation Complete - File Service Feature

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **FileService Page** (`/file-service`)
- ✅ File upload interface for authenticated "Cliente" users
- ✅ Multiple file selection and preview
- ✅ Authentication check and role validation
- ✅ Different UI states based on user status
- ✅ Success/error messaging
- ✅ Integration with Directus backend

### 2. **Site Header Updates**
- ✅ Login/Register links added to main navigation (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ User dropdown menu showing email and logout option
- ✅ Proper authentication state management
- ✅ Mobile-responsive authentication UI

### 3. **Backend Integration**
- ✅ `DirectusService.uploadFiles()` - uploads files to Directus
- ✅ `DirectusService.updateUserFileService()` - updates user's File_service field
- ✅ Proper error handling and authentication token management

## 📋 Next Steps - Directus Configuration

You need to configure Directus before testing:

### Required in Directus Admin Panel:

1. **Add File_service field to directus_users collection**
   - Field type: Many-to-Many or Files
   - Allow multiple files
   - See: `DIRECTUS_FILE_SERVICE_SETUP.md` for detailed steps

2. **Configure Cliente role permissions**
   - Allow CREATE on `directus_files`
   - Allow UPDATE on `directus_users` (own records)
   - See: `DIRECTUS_FILE_SERVICE_SETUP.md` for exact rules

3. **Verify Cliente role ID matches .env**
   - Current: `VITE_DIRECTUS_CLIENTE_ROLE_ID=6c969db6-03d6-4240-b944-d0ba2bc56fc4`

## 📂 Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. `/src/pages/FileService.tsx` - Complete rewrite with upload functionality
2. `/src/components/layout/SiteHeader.tsx` - Added login/register/user menu
3. `/src/services/directusService.ts` - Added uploadFiles() and updateUserFileService()

### Created Files:
1. `/FILE_SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation documentation
2. `/DIRECTUS_FILE_SERVICE_SETUP.md` - Step-by-step Directus configuration guide

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario 1: Unauthenticated User
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/file-service`
2. Should see login prompt with Login/Register buttons
3. Click "Fazer Login" → redirected to login page with return URL
4. After login, automatically redirected back to file service

### Test Scenario 2: Cliente User Upload
1. Login as a user with "Cliente" role
2. Navigate to `/file-service`
3. Should see welcome message and upload interface
4. Select one or more files
5. Click "Enviar Ficheiros"
6. Should see success message
7. In Directus admin, check user's File_service field has the files

### Test Scenario 3: Non-Cliente User
1. Login as a user WITHOUT "Cliente" role (e.g., editor)
2. Navigate to `/file-service`
3. Should see "Access Denied" message
4. Prompted to contact support

### Test Scenario 4: Header Navigation
1. While logged out, check header shows Login/Register buttons
2. Login, check header shows user dropdown with email
3. Click dropdown, should see logout option
4. Click logout, should clear session and redirect

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow:
```
User → Login → Session Token → Upload Request → Directus API
                                                     ↓
                                            Validate Token & Role
                                                     ↓
                                            Store Files & Update User
```

### File Upload Process:
```
1. User selects files (stored in React state)
2. Validates auth & role (client-side UX)
3. Calls DirectusService.uploadFiles()
   → Uploads to /files endpoint
   → Returns array of file IDs
4. Calls DirectusService.updateUserFileService()
   → Fetches current user data
   → Appends new file IDs to existing
   → Updates user record
5. Shows success message, resets form
```

### Security Layers:
- ✅ Client-side role check (UX)
- ✅ Session token required (authentication)
- ✅ Directus permissions (authorization)
- ✅ Users can only update own records
- ✅ Files associated with uploading user

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution**: The project should auto-compile. If you see errors:
```bash
cd /Users/jorgenunes/2026/keyprog-local/react-frontend
npm run build
```

### Issue: Import errors for Card or Dropdown components
**Solution**: These components already exist in the project. If you see errors, restart the dev server.

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@/contexts/auth-context'"
**Solution**: This file exists. Try:
1. Restart TypeScript server (VS Code: Cmd+Shift+P → "Restart TS Server")
2. Restart dev server

### Issue: Login redirect doesn't work
**Solution**: Check that:
- Routes are configured in App.tsx (they are)
- Login page handles `?return=` query parameter (it does)
- Navigation uses proper return URL

## 📱 UI/UX Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Loading States**: Shows spinner while checking auth
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for users
- **Success Feedback**: Confirmation when upload completes
- **File Preview**: Shows selected files before upload
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows "Enviando..." during upload
- **Auto-cleanup**: Clears form after successful upload

## 🎨 Design Consistency

- Uses existing UI components (Button, Card, etc.)
- Follows project's design system
- Matches existing page layouts
- Consistent with other pages' authentication flows

## ✨ Features Ready for Use

Once Directus is configured, the following features are fully functional:

- ✅ File upload for Cliente users
- ✅ Login/Register in header
- ✅ User authentication dropdown
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ File association with user accounts
- ✅ Mobile-responsive interface
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback

## 📖 Documentation

Complete documentation available in:
- `FILE_SERVICE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Technical implementation details
- `DIRECTUS_FILE_SERVICE_SETUP.md` - Directus configuration guide

---

## 🎯 Summary

The File Service feature is **fully implemented** in the React frontend. The only remaining step is to **configure Directus** following the guide in `DIRECTUS_FILE_SERVICE_SETUP.md`.

**Ready to test!** After Directus configuration is complete, all functionality will work as specified.
